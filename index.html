            width="100" height="100">My name is Anthony Ngu, I am 30 years old and I was born and raised in Utah! My beautiful Wife and I have been married
        for 5 years, and we have 2 crazy boys that absolutley run our lives, and we love it. I decided to go into Web Development
        for a career change but I have been interested in this for quite some time. I have always wondered how all these companies 
        create and design their websites and I am excited to learn and be a part of this ever growing industry.
